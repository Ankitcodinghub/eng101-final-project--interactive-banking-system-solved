Project Title: Interactive Banking System

Project Description:

The main objective is to implement a functional banking system using the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming studied in class. In this project, each team is required to develop a console-based banking system, where in the user can perform the following main actions:

â€¢ Withdraw/Deposit cash

â€¢ Display remaining balance

â€¢ Modify PIN code

â€¢ Transfer cash between accounts

Similar to most ATM terminals, the program should intake some input from the user and depending on the userâ€™s action request, it should intereact with the database (in this case, the database.csv file provided) to execute the action. Upon running the program, the screen should provide the following options on display:

As shown above, the name you selected for your team should be displayed in place of &lt;Your Team Name&gt;. At first, the user should be asked to enter his/her card number (we assume it to be a 6-digit number). If the format of the number entered is verified with the database, then the user should be asked to enter the corresponding PIN code (we assume it to be a 4-digit number).

If either the card number or PIN code is incorrect, then the program should display the error and ask the user to enter the number as follows:

Once the card number and PIN code match the entry in the database provided, the next screen should display the following options to select from:

</div>

</table>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
In what follows, each of the 6 actions will be discussed in detail:

1. Withdraw Cash:

If the user selects this option (by entering 1), then the program should display the following:

</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
The Bank of &lt;Your Team Name&gt;

Current balance: 1,234,567 KZT Enter amount to withdraw: 5000

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
The user should see the current amount remaining in the account, followed by the amount to be withdrawn. If the amount requested to be withdrawn exceed the current balance, an approporaite message should be displayed to the user, thus informing and allowing him/her to withdraw a lesser amount. Once the amount is withdrawn, it shold be deducted from the balance and updated in the database. In the above example, if the user withdraws 5,000 KZT, the amount stored in the csv file should be 1,234,567 â€“ 5,000 = 1,229,567 KZT. If the action is successful, you can display something similar to what is shown below, allowing the user to return to the main menu (by typing â€˜yâ€™) or end the session (by typing â€˜nâ€™):

</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
The Bank of &lt;Your Team Name&gt;

Cash withdrawn successfully! Remaining balance: 1,229,567 KZT

Would you like to return to the main menu? (Y/N)

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<ol start="2">
<li>Deposit Cash:
This action is very similar to withdrawing cash, except that the amount entered by the user should be summed with the current balance in the account and displayed accordingly.
</li>
<li>Modify PIN:
The user usually selects this option if he/she wants to activate a new card or change the PIN code of an existing card. Therefore, your program should check the PIN code of the card number provided by the user as input. If the corresponding PIN code is a 4-digit number in the database, it implies that the card is an already active card and the
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
user intends to change the code to a new 4-digit code (probably due to security reasons!). However, if the PIN code in the database is a 4-character code (such as 2a*1, #ssa, 0_2!), it means that the card is new and has to be activated (by changing the 4-character code to a pure 4-digit code) before being used for any transactions.

Once the PIN code is set, the display should have an option for the user to either return to the main menu page or exit.

4. Show Balance:

If the user opts for this action, the program should display the following information, which shold be retrieved from the database (Assume USD to KZT to USD xchange rate to be 1 USD = 450 KZT):

</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
The Bank of &lt;Your Team Name&gt;

Card owner: Pete Jones

Card number: 581058

Current balance in KZT: 1,229,567 Current balance in USD: 2,732 Last transaction: â€“ 5000 KZT

Would you like to return to the main menu? (Y/N)

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
5. Transfer Between Accounts:

Under this option, the user is required to enter the 6-digit number of the beneficiaryâ€™s account and the amount to be transferred as shown below:

</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
The Bank of &lt;Your Team Name&gt;

**Commission for fund transfers over 20,000 KZT is 500 KZT

Beneficiaryâ€™s card number: 912510 Transfer amount (in KZT): 15000

Beneficiaryâ€™s name: Aresh Dadlani Conform transfer? (Y/N): Y

Transfer successful!

Would you like to return to the main menu? (Y/N)

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
There are a number of points to be noticed while implementing this option. Firstly, the program should check and verify if the beneficiaryâ€™s card number exists in the database or not. If not, it should display the error to the user and ask to re-enter the correct card number. Secondly, the fund transferred should not exceed the current amaount available in the senderâ€™s account. Thirdly, if the fund being transferred is more than 20,000 KZT, the program should automatically deduct 500 KZT from the senderâ€™s account after making the transfer. For instance, the example shown above, no commissionw ill be taken from the senderâ€™s balance as the fund being transferred in exactly 20,000 KZT. Also, keep in mind that if the sender intends to transfer fund more than 20,000 KZT, there should be at least 500 KZT remaining in the senderâ€™s account that will be then reduced for the commission fee. Otherwise, the transcations should be carried out successfully and the user should be informed about it with an appropriate display message on the screen.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Finally, if a transfer is made between cards from two different banks (indicated using the â€˜Bank ID field in the csv file), then 200 KZT is deducted from the senderâ€™s account irrespective of the amount being transferred.

6. End Session

If the user selects this option, the program should show a good bye message and return to the very first screenshot, where a new user has to enter a card number and PIN code to initiate an action.
